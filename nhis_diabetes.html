									<h1>National Health Interview Survey<br />
									</h1>
									<p>The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has monitored the health of the nation since 1957. NHIS data on a broad range of health topics are collected through personal household interviews. Survey results have been instrumental in providing data to track health status, health care access, and progress toward achieving national health objectives.</p>
								</header>
								<p>The National Center for Health Statistics provide annual national estimates of selected health topics for adults <br />
									aged 18 years and over based on final data from the National Health Interview Survey.<br />
									Estimates can be grouped by characteristics such as age, race, or sex.<br />
									However, if a person would like to know how the people surveyed are distributed, they would not be able to do it.
									</p>
								<h3>Ask:</h3>
									<p>The first step is to determine what informaiton is needed.<br/>
										I'll analyse the survey responses to determine how the US 2020 diabetic population is distributed:
										<li>How many people were surveyed?</li>
										<li>How many diabetic patients were surveyed?</li>
										<li>How are the patients distributed by gender?</li>
										<li>What race do most diabetic patients belongs to?</li>
										<li>What diabetes type do most diabetic patients belongs to?</li>
										<li>What family income do most diabetic patients belongs to?</li>
										<li>What education level do most diabetic patients belongs to?</li>
									</p>
								<h3>Prepare:</h3>
								<p>This dataset was downloaded from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics website as a CSV file.
									It contains the 2020 adults survey responses.<br />
									You can access the dataset by clicking on this link: 
									<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2020nhis.htm">2020 NHIS</a><br/>
									I imported the CSV file into SQLServer to clean and analyse the data.
								</p>
								<h3>Process:</h3>
								<p>I first wanted to check how many columns were in the dataset and their information:
								</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>-- To check columns information
SELECT 
	*
FROM 
	INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE 
	table_name = 'adult20'</code></pre>
								<p>I found there were 317 columns in the dataset and they were real data type.
								</p>
								<img src="images/NHIS/Total_rows.png" alt=""><br />
								<img src="images/NHIS/Column_info.png" alt="" style="width:548.66px;height:170.66px;"><br />
								<p>I used the 2020 NHIS codebook to find which columns I would need for the Analysis:
								</p>
								<img src="images/NHIS/Adult_codebook.png" alt="" style="width:261.33px;height:120.66px;"><br />
								<img src="images/NHIS/Codebook_reference.png" alt="" style="width:424.66px;height:388px;"><br />
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>-- To get the columns I need for the analysis
SELECT
	SEX_A AS Gender,
	HISPALLP_A AS Race,
	DIBEV_A AS Diagnosed_Diabetes,
	DIBTYPE_A AS Diabetes_type,
	EDUC_A AS Education_level,
	INCGRP_A AS Family_income
FROM 
	adult20
</code></pre>
								<p>I chose to save the results into a new table as the original dataset can be used to analyse other medical conditions.
								</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>-- To check for null values
